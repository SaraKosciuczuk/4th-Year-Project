# 4th-Year-Project
 
# Designing concept art for a game, with a 3D model and VFX programming, in a similar form to a game art book. 

# Creating the aesthetic of the environment, characters and creatures for a (non-existent yet) game. 

# The inspiration comes from Animal Jam, Monster Hunter and other games. 

# The genre of the game will be fantasy, rpg. 

# Set in future Tokyo, Japan, which has been invaded by alien creatures. 

# This project will contain research documents, moodboards, sketches and final art and models of the environment, characters and creatures, and tools or weapons. 

# Final outcome will be a digital artbook presentation.
